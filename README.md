# Xenserver

The usernames and passwords in this documentation are not working. Even as the URL that is provided here. This was an project which i ran in 2013 in Xenserver. So this servers passwords are changed and are also long gone as a system.

This is only to show of some features i worked on during the creation of a service where you could hire an VPS from a service i worked on. Included are all the changes you can make today with VPS providers. We also had working features to connect multiple servers into a internal network bij creating a VLAN and attaching an extra network adapter to these networks.
